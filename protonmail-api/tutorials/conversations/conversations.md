A conversation is a group of related emails. Algorithms on the server side of ProtonMail determine how to group emails into conversations. Conversations have many similar properties as individual emails, such as labels, moving folders, and stars. With this API you can choose to work with individual emails, or with conversations. Both can be fetched and sorted in a similar fashion. Working with individual emails is recommended because it is more predictable (conversation grouping is a black box).
